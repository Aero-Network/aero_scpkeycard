This addon is available on the Workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1781514401)!

## Description
There are **8 weapons** including **6 keycards** (LVL 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Omni), **1 keycard editor** and a **Credit Card** (Master Card).

With the **keycard editor**, you can change the current settings by pressing **Reload** key (basically 'R'), a panel will open on your screen. 

### Console Commands
+ `guthscp_save_keycards` : to save the data after edit the buttons with the keycard editor
+ `guthscp_load_keycards` : to load the data (but it is done automatically, so ignore it)

The keycards data is loaded when a server reboot and after a cleanup.

### Console Variables
• `guthen_scp_keycard_secondary_drop` (`1`: true, `0`: false) : Enables the keycard's SWEPs to be dropped on right click

### Additionnal modules
• [[SCP] Hacking Device by zgredinzyyy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2019852698)

## Known Issues
### "I can't open the Settings Menu with the Keycard Editor!"
In **singleplayer game**, you won't be able to open the configuration panel with Reload key, start a multiplayer game instead (2 players or more)
### "I can open an accredidated door without a keycard!" 
Some addons ─ which use the **PlayerUse** hook ─ disable my addon. This [Piano](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796397853) addon is known to disable it, remove it.
